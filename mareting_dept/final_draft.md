        # Marketing Campaign Final Draft

        ## Email Marketing
        ### Potential Client List
        The Email Marketing Specialist provided a list of 10 potential email list sources, each requiring further filtering and potentially a combination of lists to effectively reach the target audience for the Tesla Model 5 launch campaign.  The list focuses on industry leaders and professionals (age 30-55, upper-middle to high income, environmentally conscious, tech-savvy, early adopters), aligning with the campaign's focus on innovation, affordability, sustainability, and seamless integration.  The list is not a list of specific emails, but rather a list of vendors that house lists that need to be filtered by the Email Marketing Specialist to meet the requirements of the project.  Due to the limitations of available tools, I cannot provide 10 specific email addresses.
